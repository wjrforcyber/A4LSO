\section*{Note}
\begin{itemize}
    \item This assignment left a few lines of blank after each problem, but it might not be enough space for the answer and it is recommended to write on a separate sheet.
    \item You could reference open source projects to finish but answer should be written with clearly illustration.
    \item Example cases can be found at EPFL combinational benchmark \cite{EPFLCombBenchmark}.
    \item Referenced thesis in the assignment may contain SOTA research, but do not spend too much time on recommended thesis unless you finish the assignment first.
    \item For those who have no background in logic synthesis, finish reading chapter 6 of \cite{EDA2009} will be a good start before starting this assignment.

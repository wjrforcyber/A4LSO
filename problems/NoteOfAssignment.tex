\begin{itemize}
    \item This assignment left a few lines of blank after each problem, but it might not be enough space for the answer and it is recommended to write on a separate sheet.
    \item You could reference open source projects to finish but answer should be written with clearly illustration.
    \item Example cases can be found at EPFL combinational benchmark \cite{EPFLCombBenchmark}.
    \item Do not spend too much time on recommended thesis, assignment first.
